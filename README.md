# CodeCademy: Data Science Foundations Project 

## Cool T-Shirt Page Funnel Visit 

## Goal 

The goal of this notebook was to describe the process of a user visiting a site. 
By using the merge function I merged three data frames in order to display revelevant information. 
This information was used to find the following percentages. 
    1. Of users who visited the page and didnt buy anything. 
    2. Of users who added a t-shirt to their cart and didn't checkout. 
    3 Of users who made it to checkout and did not purchase a t-shirt. 

By left merging relevant information from the three DataFrames I'm able to calculate the average time to purchase.
